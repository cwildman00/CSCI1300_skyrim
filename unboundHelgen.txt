> You wake in a wagon rolling along a bumpy road. Your hands are bound and 
  you are joined by three other prisoners: all Nords, one an average farmer, 
  the man across from you in blue Stormcloak armor, and the one beside you 
  dressed in a Jarl's finery, gagged. Armed Imperial soldiers surround the wagon 
  on all sides.

[CONT]

Ralof: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
       right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
       thief over there. 

[CONT]

Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
       nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen
       that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we
       should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.

Ralof: We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.

Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!

[CONT]

Thief to the finely dressed man: And what's wrong with him?

Ralof: Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
       King.

Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if
       they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?

Ralof: I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.

Lokir: No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.

[CONT]

> The wagon approaches a heavily guarded village. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!

General Tullius: Good. Let's get this over with.

Thief: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.

Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
       the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do
       with this.  

[CONT]

Ralof: This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod
       is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny...when I
       was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

> The wagon stops near the chopping block.

Imperial Soldier: Whoa.

Thief: Why are they stopping?

Ralof: Why do you think? End of the line. Let's go. Shouldn't keep the gods
       waiting for us.

Thief: No! Wait! We're not rebels!

Ralof: Face your death with some courage, thief.

[CONT]

> Under the Imperials' watchful eye, the prisoners start jumping out.

Thief: You've got to tell them! We weren't with you! This is a mistake!

Imperial Captain: Step toward the block when we call your name. One at a time!

Ralof: Empire loves their damn lists.

[CONT]

Hadvar: Ulfric Stormcloak. Jarl of Windhelm.

Ralof: It has been an honor, Jarl Ulfric!

Hadvar: Ralof of Riverwood. Lokir of Rorikstead.

Lokir: No, I'm not a rebel! You can't do this!

> The thief panicks makes a break for it.

Imperial Captain: Halt!

Lokir: You're not going to kill me!

[CONT]

Imperial Captain: Archers!

> Lokir is downed with one bowshot.

Imperial Captain: Anyone else feel like running?

Hadvar: Wait, you there. Step forward. Who are you?

[SET UP] 

Hadvar: Captain, what should we do? They're not on the list.

Imperial Captain: Forget the list. They go to the block.

Hadvar: By your orders, captain. I'm sorry. We'll be sure your remains are 
        returned to your home. Follow the Captain, prisoner.

[CONT]

> You move to stand with the other waiting prisoners by the block.

Tullius: Ulfric Stormcloak. Some here in Helgen call you a hero, but a hero
         doesn't use a power like the Voice to murder his king and usurp his
         throne.

Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak: (grunting protest)

Tullius: You started this war, plunged Skyrim into chaos and now the Empire is
         going to put you down, and restore the peace.

[CONT]

> A distant noise rings down the mountainside.

Hadvar: What was that?

Tullius: It's nothing. Carry on.

Imperial Captain: Yes, General Tullius. Give them their last rites.

[CONT]

Priestess of Arkay: As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the
                    Eight Divines upon you, for you are the salt and earth of
                    Nirn, our beloved--

> One of the prisoners from the lead wagon walks forward.

Stormcloak Soldier: For the love of Talos, shut up and lets get this over with.

Priestess of Arkay: As you wish...

[CONT]

Stormcloak Soldier: Come on, I haven't got all morning. My ancestors are
                    smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?

> The executioner swiftly beheads the soldier. The Nord's fellow soldiers 
  begin to yell at their captors while townsfolk cheer

Stormcloak Soldier 2: You Imperial bastards!

Helgen Citizen 1: Justice!

Helgen Citizen 2: Death to the Stormcloaks!

Ralof: As fearless in death as he was in life.

[CONT]

Imperial Captain: Next!

Another cry rings out on the mountainside, this time much closer.

Hadvar: There it is again. Did you hear that?

Imperial Captain: I said, next prisoner!

Hadvar: To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.

[CONT]

> You're brought to the chopping block, neck laid exposed on the stone.
  A large creature swoops over the southern peaks, barreling toward Helgen.

Tullius: What in Oblivion is that?

Imperial Captain: Sentries! What do you see?

Imperial Soldier: It's in the clouds!

> The creature, clearly a dragon, lands on the nearest tower and releases a 
  gout of flame just as the executioner raises his axe. The man falls aside dead,
  your head remaining well attached to your shoulders

Stormcloak Soldier: Dragon!

[CONT]

Tullius: Don't just stand there, kill that thing! Guards, get the townspeople
         to safety!

Ralof: Hey, get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance! This way!

[CONT]

> You follow Ralof through the burning village to a tower where the other prisoners are hiding.

Ralof: Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?

Ulfric: Legends don't burn down villages. We need to move, now!

[CONT]

Ralof: Up through the tower. Let's go! This way, friend! Move!

> Stormcloak Soldier: We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!

> The dragon breaks in through the wall, blasting fire everywhere.

Ralof: Get back!

Dragon: Toor shul!

[CONT]

> You follow Ralof up the stairs and examine a nearby burning building

Ralof: See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going! Go!
       We'll follow you when we can!

> You continue alone, jumping from the tower into the burning inn. From there you 
  make your way to the ground floor and back outside, the Imperial with the list 
  crouched nearby with some other refugees.

[CONT]

Hadvar: Haming, you need to get over here now! Thataboy. You're doing great!
        Torolf! Gods...everyone get back!

> The dragon releases another grout of flame, narrowly missing the small group

Hadvar: Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way.
        Gunnar, take care of the boy. I have to find General Tullius and join
        the defense.

Gunnar: Gods guide you, Hadvar.

[CONT]

> You follow Hadvar onward without the other refugees

Hadvar: Stay close to the wall!

[CONT]

> The dragon lands on the wall above, launching flame at all it can see

Dragon: Vol toor shul!

Hadvar: Quickly, follow me!

[CONT]

> You reach the main keep where archers are fighting in vain to shoot the beast down

Helgen Citizen: Tell my family I fought bravely!

Tullius: Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!

Hadvar: It's you and me, prisoner, stay close!

> Near the keep, Ralof can be seen with his comrades.

[CONT]

Hadvar: Ralof! You damned traitor, out of my way!

Ralof: We're escaping, Hadvar! You're not stopping us this time.

Hadvar: Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.

> Ralof turns to you and beckons you follow

[CONT]

Ralof: You, come on! Into the keep!

Hadvar: With me, prisoner! Let's go! Come on! We need to get inside!
