Hadvar: Looks like we're the only ones who made it. Was that really a dragon?
        The bringers of the End Times? We should keep moving. Come here. Let me
        see if I can get those bindings off. There you go. Take a look around,
        there should be plenty of gear to choose from. I'm going to see if I
        can find something for these burns. You better get that armor on. Give
        sword a few swings, too. Let's keep moving. That thing is still out
        there. Come on, this way.

> You and your companion venture deeper into the keep, coming into a large torch-
  lit room with two Stormcloaks inside.

Stormcloak Soldier 1: We need to get moving! That dragon is tearing up the whole
                      keep!

Stormcloak Soldier 2: Just give me a minute...I'm out of breath...

[CONT]

Hadvar: Hear that? Stormcloaks. Maybe we can reason with them. Hold on now, we
        only want to...

The Stormcloak soldiers draw their weapons.

Hadvar: If you want to die, so be it.

[CONT]

Hadvar: That's the end of that. Let's see if I can get that door open.

They go downstairs, just in time to miss being crushed under a collapsing ceiling.

Hadvar: Look out! Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.

[CONT]

Stormcloak: What are you doing? We need to get out of Helgen now!

Stormcloak 2: The Imperials have potions in here. We're going to need them.

        handy.

Hadvar: Done then? This way!

[CONT]

Downstairs is a torture room where the workers are fighting Stormcloaks.

Hadvar: A torture room. Gods, I wish we didn't need these...

Torturer: You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed quite
          upset at how I'd been entertaining their comrades.

Hadvar: Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!

[CONT]

Torturer: A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense...although, come to think
          of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there.

Hadvar: Come with us. We need to get out of here.

Torturer: You have no authority over me, boy.

Hadvar: Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!

Torturer's Assistant: Forget the old man. I'll come with you.

[CONT]

Hadvar: Wait a second, looks like there's something in this cage.

Torturer: Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow
          screamed for weeks.

Hadvar: See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we
        can get.

Torturer: Sure, take all my things. Please.

Hadvar: Grab what you can and let's go.

Hadvar gives you three lockpicks to use on the Torturer's cage.

[CONT]

Torturer: There's no way out that way, you know...

You and Hadvar continue further downstairs.

Hadvar: Alright, let's see if we can find a way out. Let's see where this goes.

You open a bridge into a network of tunnels, passing over before a falling rock breaks it, killing the Torturer's assistant. 

[CONT]

Hadvar: Damn it. No going back that way. I guess we're lucky that didn't come
        down on top of us. We better push on. I'm sure the others will find
        another way out.

The pair of you follow a stream until it leads to a dead end.

Hadvar: Hmm, that doesn't go anywhere. I guess we'd better try this way.

[CONT]

He leads you down a different tunnel deeper into the cavern until voices can be
heard. Hadvar halts upbruptly, holding up a cautionary hand.

Hadvar: Hold up. There's Ralof up ahead with a few of his comrades. I'd rather not
        tangle with them right now, but I don't see any way around. Up for one last
        fight, my friend?

Ralof: Hadvar, you faithless bastard! I'll kill you for all my comrades you've sent
       to Sovngarde!

Hadvar: Give it your best shot, Stormcloak!

Hadvar: That was messier than I would have liked. Talos guide them all... This looks 
        like the way out! I was starting to wonder if we'd ever make it.

You run toward the exit he had pointed to, embracing the fresh air. A hand grabs the 
back of your tunic and briskly pulls you back.

Hadvar: Wait!

[CONT]

A large shadow passes over as the dragon flies away into the mountains.

Hadvar: Looks like he's gone for good this time. But I don't think we should
        stick around to see if he comes back. Closest town from here is
        Riverwood. My uncle's the blacksmith there. I'm sure he could help you
        out. It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I wouldn't have made
        it without your help today.

With nowhere better to go, you follow the Imperial down the road to Riverwood. 
So begins the tale of the legendary Dragonborn.
