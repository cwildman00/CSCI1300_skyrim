Ralof: We'll meet again in Sovngarde, brother. Looks like we're the only ones
       who made it. That thing was a dragon. No doubt. Just like the children's
       stories and the legends. The harbingers of the End Times. We better get
       moving. Come here, let me see if I can get those bindings off. There you
       go. May as well take Gunjar's gear...he won't be needing it anymore.
       Alright, get that armor on and give that axe a few swings. I'm going to
       see if I can find some way out of here. 

> You pick up the fallen Stormcloak's gear while your companion looks about the
  room.

Ralof: This door's locked. Let's see about that gate. Damn. No way to open this 
       from our side.

> As if on que, voices can be heard from the other side of the gate.

[CONT]

Imperial Captain: Come on, soldier! Keep moving!

Ralof: It's the Imperials! Take cover!

Ralof: Maybe one of these Imperials has the key. Let's see here... 

[CONT]

Ralof: Here we are, found a key. Let's see if it opens that door. That's it! 
       Come on, let's get out of here before the dragon brings the whole 
       tower down on our heads.


> You go downstairs, just in time to miss being crushed under a collapsing ceiling.

Ralof: Look out! Damn, that dragon doesn't give up easy.

[CONT]

> Ralof leads the way into a large storeroom, where even more Imperials 
  can be heard moving about.

Imperial Soldier 1: Grab everything important and let's move! The dragon is
                  burning everything to the ground.

Imperial Soldier 2: Just need to gather some more potions.

[CONT]

Imperial Soldier 1: Stormcloaks!

Ralof: Done? Let's get moving.

[CONT]

> The pair of you go downstairs to what appears to be a torture chamber, where 
  some of Ralof's fellow Stormcloaks are fighting.

Ralof: Troll's blood! It's a torture room. Hear that?

Ralof: Is Jarl Ulfric with you?

Stormcloak Soldier: No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.

Ralof: Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage. It's locked.
       See if you can get it open with some picks. We might need that gold once
       we get out. Grab anything useful and let's go.

[LOCKPICK]

> You continue further downstairs, finding even more soldiers.

Imperial Soldier: The orders are to wait until General Tullius arrives.

Imperial Soldier 2: I'm not waiting to be killed by a dragon!

Stormcloak Soldier: You Imperial bastards will pay!

[COMBAT]
Imperial Soldier,Imperial,M,Steel Mace,One Handed,10,14,65,Studded Imperial Armor,Light,23,6,125,yes

Ralof: Let's go on ahead. See if the way is clear. Let's see where this goes.

> You come to a bridge that is lowered by pulling a lever. Ralof pulls it and you run across,
  narrowly avoiding a falling rock. The Stormcloak who had joined you lies dead under the rubble.

Ralof: No going back that way, now. We'd better push on. The rest of them will
       have to find another way out.

> You follow a stream into a network of tunnels until you come to a dead end.

Ralof: Hmm, that doesn't go anywhere. I guess we'd better try this way.

> Ralof leads down a different passage for a while until stopping to rest.

Ralof: Sit for a moment. That dragon is still going to be flying around out 
       there. No point in rushing out to greet it so quick. Looks like there's
       an exit just that way.

> Hadvar and another Imperial soldier enter the cavern, swords drawn. Ralof bristles
  and draws his axe.

Ralof: Hadvar, you faithless bastard! I'll kill you for all my comrades you've sent
       to Sovngarde!

Hadvar: Give it your best shot, Stormcloak!

[COMBAT]
Hadvar,Nord,M,Steel Greatsword,Two Handed,17,17,90,Studded Imperial Armor,Light,23,6,125

Ralof: That takes care of that. Let's get out of here before anyone else finds us.

> They watch as Alduin flies overhead and away.

Ralof: Wait! There he goes. Looks like he's gone for good this time. No way to
       know if anyone else made it out alive. But this place is going to be
       swarming with Imperials soon enough. We'd better clear out of here. My
       sister Gerdur runs the mill in Riverwood, just up the road. I'm sure
       she'd help you out. It's probably best if we split up. Good luck. I
       wouldn't have made it without your help today.

> With nowhere better to go, you follow the Stormcloak down the road to Riverwood. 
So begins the tale of the legendary Dragonborn.
